## Overview
Protein activity is a significant characteristic for recombinant proteins which can be used as biocatalysts. Since protein activity and solubility are correlated for some proteins, the publicly available solubility dataset may be adopted to develop models that can predict protein solubility from sequence. In literature, predicting protein solubility from sequence has been intensively explored, but the predicted solubility represented in binary values from all the developed models was not suitable for guiding experimental designs to improve protein solubility. We first implemented a novel approach that predicted protein solubility in continuous numerical values instead of binary ones. After combining it with various machine learning algorithms, we achieved a R2 of 0.4115 when Support Vector Machine (SVM) algorithm was used.
